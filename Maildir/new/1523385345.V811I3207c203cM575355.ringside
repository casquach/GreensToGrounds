			Message: I have the Full Season Produce Box but I have mild allergic reactions to both collards and beets. Would it be possible to switch these items out with some of the items in the snack box (especially the hummus and baguette!) or the PB&J Box? Or maybe there's excess kale or tomatoes or something from last week? Thanks for the consideration- please let me know soon!
